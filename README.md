# HAPCAN-Ethernet_interface


## TODO:
 - There is an OpenWRT package to program STM32s directly using the Mediatek SoC GPIO pins. Implement that? [https://hackaday.io/project/166859-prism/log/166980-braaains]
 - Replace the MCP3422 ADC by the MCP3423 because of the I2C address collision with BQ32000.
 - Look into replacing the CANable interface by MCP2515?
